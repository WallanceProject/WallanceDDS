# Wallance, an Alternative to Blockchain for IoT (Tutorial)


## Introduction

We propose a lightweight alternative to blockchain, called *Wallance* to secure interactions in a decentralized IoT infrastructure. Taking into account all its constraints as memory, computing power and energy, our proof of concept promotes the sharing of data and the utilization of services as a real IoT network, in a secure way.

In this tutorial, we will install step by step *WallanceDDS* Node (on Raspberry Pi3 Model B+) and *WallanceDDS* User Interface (on PC) based on Grafana. A complete description of our protocol is available on our paper "*Wallance, an Alternative to Blockchain for IoT*". *WallanceDDS* is a special *Wallance* implementation using OpenDDS, an open source implementation of the Object Management Group (OMG) Data Distribution Service (DDS).

## Prerequisites

- A Linux environment
- About 2GB is required
- At least 3 Raspberry Pi are required
- An internet connection is required
<br><br>


## Install *WallanceDDS*

Download and launch the installer *Install_WallanceDDS.sh*. In a terminal on your **PC**:
<pre><code>wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WallanceProject/WallanceDDS/master/Install_WallanceDDS.sh
chmod +x Install_WallanceDDS.sh
./Install_WallanceDDS.sh</code></pre>

This operation takes about 45 minutes, depending on your PC’s performances. At the end of the process, you should see the "WallanceProject" directory in your $HOME.<br>

The contents of the "WallanceProject" directory is described below:

**WARNING: Before continuing, make sure your PC and Raspberry are on the same network.**
<br><br>


## Install *WallanceDDS* Node (Raspberry)

### Prerequisites

- Ensure an image of a Linux distribution is already available on Raspberry.<br>
- An internet connection is required
- For a best experience, copy your Public RSA key into each Raspberry to enable the automatic login through SSH

### Installation

In a terminal on your **PC**:
<pre><code>cd $HOME/WallanceProject/WallanceDDS
./Update_Node.sh</code></pre>

This command automatically install the *WallanceDDS* Node in the $HOME directory (typically */home/pi/*) in each connected Raspberry through SSH connection.<br>

At the end of the installation, the *WallanceDDS* directory in Raspberry is as follow:
<br><br>

| **Directory/File** | **Description** |
| :--------------: | :-----------: |
| Consensus/ | *WallanceDDS* database directory |
| OpenDDS/DDS.bin | Binary of OpenDDS (Main Part) |
| OpenDDS/rtps.ini | Configuration file of OpenDDS |
| Pipes/ | Pipes of process interconnections |
| Run_Node.sh | Script to launch *WallanceDDS* Node (Raspberry only) |
| Sensor/Sensor.bin | Binary of the virtual sensor|
| SmartContract/ | Binary of all Smart Contracts (Services) |

<br>


## Run *WallanceDDS*

In a terminal on your **PC**:
<pre><code>cd $HOME/WallanceProject/WallanceDDS
./Run_Grafana_Interface.sh</code></pre>

This command start the *WallanceDDS* Node on each Raspberry and the *WallanceDDS* User Interface on PC. The Grafana dashboard is opened into a Firefox window. The first connection login is “admin” and the password is “admin”. You can change the password after logging in:
<br><br>

Finally, the *WallanceDDS* User Interface is ready.
<br><br>
![](ReadMeImages/Grafana2.PNG)

(1): Select Node(s) to display<br>
(2): Information of Node (1 Node per Line)<br>
(3): Button to purchase a service<br>
(4): Node's purchase in process (*Request Transaction*)<br>
(5): Node's Wallet (*DCoin*)<br>
(6): List of available Smart Contracts (Services)<br>
(7): Select Smart Contract (Services) to purchase<br>
(8): *Consensus Transactions*<br>
<br>


## Utilization of *WallanceDDS* User Interface (PC)

On Grafana, a service can be purchase on behalf of a Raspberry, by clicking on the button "Buy Service" under the selected Raspberry. The service will be purchased only when the Raspberry will have enough DCoins.
<br><br>
![](ReadMeImages/GrafanaButton.PNG)

By default, the ID of each Raspberry is the last byte of the IP Address.<br>

Note: the list of Node is updated when the Raspberry sends data. Consequently, it can take time to display all Raspberry, according to their sending.<br>

During the first purchase, the pop-up window below appears. Firefox asks the permission to open the launcher of purchase application from Grafana.<br>
Select "Remember my choice for app links" and click on "Open link".
<br><br>
![](ReadMeImages/Grafana3.PNG)

Once a purchase is executed, a *Request Transaction* is generated and displayed on the User Interface in "Node x - *Request Transactions*" panel.<br>

After that, if all conditions are met, the other Nodes send their agreement thanks to a *Consensus Transaction*, displayed on "*Consensus Transactions*" panel.<br>

Below, an example of the interface, showing 'Node1' and 'Node2' with:<br>
- *Request Transaction* of Node1 (in "Node1 - *Request Transactions*" panel)<br>
- *Consensus Transaction* of Node 2 for the *Request Transaction* of Node1 (in "*Consensus Transactions*" panel)

![](ReadMeImages/Grafana4.PNG)

Finally, the consensus process is computed, the *Request Transaction* / *Consensus Transactions* are removed and wallets are updated.
<br><br>


## Stop *WallanceDDS*

Close the Firefox window.<br>
Stop the Run_Grafana_Interface instance in your PC with <Ctrl+C>.<br>
The *WallanceDDS* Node instance on each Raspberry will be stopped automatically (using SSH)
<br><br>


## *WallanceDDS* IDE

The *WallanceDDS* installation provides a complete Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of *WallanceDDS*.

The text editor *Sublime Text* is available to edit the *WallanceDDS* source codes.

In a terminal on your **PC**:
<pre><code>subl $HOME/WallanceProject/WallanceDDS</code></pre>

### Compile *WallanceDDS* & Update *WallanceDDS* Node (Raspberry)

In a terminal on your **PC**:
<pre><code>cd $HOME/WallanceProject/WallanceDDS
./Compile_WallanceDDS.sh</code></pre>

This command updates the *WallanceDDS_Node.zip* archive with your modifications.

**If you edit the source code of *Consensus*, *OpenDDS*, *Sensor* or *SmartContract*, the updated *WallanceDDS_Node.zip* archive must be copied to each Raspberry deployed on the network.**

### Update *WallanceDDS* Node (Raspberry)

To send the updated archive to all Raspberry, in a terminal on your **PC**:
<pre><code>cd $HOME/WallanceProject/WallanceDDS
./Update_Node.sh</code></pre>
